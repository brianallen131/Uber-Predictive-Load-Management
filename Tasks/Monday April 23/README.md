**Agreed Upon Approach to Model 1**

- Model 1 is a two area model. Define the two areas according to the *relevant area*
- The inputs to the model include:
  - The true demand for Ubers from location i
  - The probability a customer in location i will choose an Uber if it comes from location j
  - The cost to Uber of relocating a car from location i to location j
  - The current number of Ubers in location i
  - The revenue for picking up an customer
- The goal is to maximize the revenue from pickups minus the cost of relocating the Uber's from their current locations
- The model can be found in the *Model 1.pdf* file
