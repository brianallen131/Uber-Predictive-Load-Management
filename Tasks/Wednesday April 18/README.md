<h2>Questions for Wednesday's Class:</h2>

* Use m/m/inf or m/m/k queue to estimate state probbailities (assume service time = time from uber request until drop-off)
* Scale model efficiently
* How to best construct a demand curve (current idea: bucket prices and draw frequency chart --> should look like a convex downward-sloping demand curve)
