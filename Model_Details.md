## Simplest Model
* Deterministic demand: assume we can perfectly predict the demand


## Simple Model
* Stocastic demand: 
  - Predicted demand follows a distribution
  - True demand: $T$
* Send $N$ cars into service areas
* Each car in service area incurs a fixed cost $K$
* Each customer gets services pays a fare amount $D_t$ follows distribution $D$
* Customers' choices depend on waiting time and price 
* Demands get lost if there is no available cars
* Cars are wasted if there is no demand
* Objective: maximize $\Sigma_t^T D_t - NK$
