## Simplest Model
* Deterministic demand: assume we can perfectly predict the demand


## Simple Model
* Stocastic demand: predicted demand follows a distribution
* Each car in service area incurs a fixed cost $K$
* Customers' choices depend on waiting time and price 
* Demands get lost if there is no available cars
* Cars are wasted if there is no demand
*
